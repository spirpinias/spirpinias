- 👋 Hi, I’m @spirpinias or you can call me Stephen.
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning, measuring things, and developing programs for odd jobs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning convex optimization by Stephen Boyd, Real Analysis by Walter Rudin, and reading Statistical Learning Theory by Vapnik.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on and see things measuring various phenomenona. 
- 📫 How to reach me by email is stpirpinias@gmail.com
- I taught myself Linear Algebra watching Gilbert Strang videos because I could not afford tuition prior to graduate school.
- I taught myself how to program and then 2 of my classmates pushed me forward in graduate school into the person I am today. George and Darshana. 
- I religiously watch MIT OCW and Stanford Engineering videos on Youtube.
- Attached Programs are Various Projects and Code I have written in the past year.
- As I think of more stuff you will find it here.
- I aspire to write simple code and never stop learning.
- Watch me go.
